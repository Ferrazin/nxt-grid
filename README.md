### NOTES

1. Choice of endpoint logic: the endpoint belongs to Grid because meters are considered sub-resources and only used in relation to grids. In larger contexts, a more general approach might be preferable. 

2. Use the DB to retrieve the latest issue instead of using JS

3. Add pagination & sorting metadata to the response

4. Add validation for pagination in request
